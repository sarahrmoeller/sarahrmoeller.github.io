              <div class="panel-body"><p> You may hear "computational linguistics" and "natural language processing (NLP)" used interchangeably. Both involve programming computers to do interesting things with language. There is no clear consensus how the two differ. Generally speaking, "computational linguistics" is used more by linguists and "NLP" by the computer science side. A class called "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" in a linguistics department but "Introduction to NLP" in a computer science department may use the same textbook and cover the same topics, but adapted to different audiences.</p>
			  
			  <p>I know one person who is insists that computational linguistics only refers to computer modeling of linguistic theories. <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-computational-linguistics-different-from-natural-language-processing">Others have addressed this more thoroughly</a>.</p></div>

I was launched into NLP by talking to computational linguists at the <a href=""http://icldc-hawaii.org/">International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation</a> (ICLDC) and I recommend this conference for anyone working in minority languages. You may find people interested in similar ideas as you <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/5960">browse its past presentations</a>.

			  <p>The Workshop for the Use of Computational Methods for Endangered Languages (<a href="https://computel-workshop.org/">ComputEL</a>) is another event that brings linguists, computer scientists, and community members. If you see a project that sounds like something you want to do, contact the authors! Be aware that some articles are fairly technical.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Not so many years ago, I was where you are now---very much interested in computational linguistics but an absolute novice in computer science. Fortunately, NLP is an exploding field and getting started should be easier for you. </p>
			  
			  <p>The first answer is what was recommended to me: find a computer scienctist who is interested in what you want to accomplish and collaborate with them. Such collaborations are producing very nice tools, such as the automated transcription tool <a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki">ELPIS</a> and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/">SignStream</a> for linguistic analysis of American Sign Language.</p>
			  
			  <p>I took the another path because the first answer did not satisfied me. If you feel the same, then it's time to dive in and practice, practice, practice until your programming skills are fluent. Computer programming has a steep, but short, learning curve. So I highly recommend investing in a programming bootcamp or classes with an instructor, unless you have loads of time. I took a free class through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>. After Programming 101, take a class in data structures and algorithms to optimize your code.</p>
			   
			  <p>After you’ve laid the programming foudnation, a degree program is probably the fastest and most efficient way to continue. The number of professional master programs in computational linguistics/NLP is growing as the industry demands grow! For example, the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/computational-linguistics-analytics-search-and-informatics">CLASIC</a> program at the University of Colorado Boulder is a establish program and the University of Washington has online program.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Great question! You can approach computational linguistics from as linguist with computer science skills or as a computer scientist who works with languages (in computer science, this is commonly known as natural language processing (NLP)). I come from the linguistics side and more than once I have regretted that I didn't take any computer science classes in my undergrad. (I majored in history - I didn't discover linguistics until after I graduated). If your school does not have a computational linguistics or NLP major, then I recommend doing a major/minor combination in linguistics and either computer science or data science.</p>
			  
			  <p>At bare minimum, if you are a linguistics major, take an introductory programming class, preferably one that teaches Python, although R has some uses. After that, take a class in data structures and algorithms. You may want to look the information science or data science courses instead of computer science, because computer science courses may be more math-heavy.</p>
			  
			  <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVQ0N5QqyTHsF1ebbabARg-VNlcSgdJJQLfe5GycPqE/edit?usp=sharing">recommended "co-requisites"</a> I compiled for the University of Colorado students. 
			  TL;DR: Life will be much easier if you are familiar with probability and statistics, linear algebra (vectors and matrices), and some calculus (basic notations and an intuitive understanding of partial derivatives). That doesn't mean you have to master those subjects, however. I found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos on linear algebra and calculus sufficient. But I really wish I had more good classes in statistics!</p>
			  
			  <p>For prospective graduate students, a very few but growing number of schools have faculty research in NLP/computational linguistics and endangered or low-resource languages. Explore faculty websites and publications to determine their research interests before you contact them. In fact, at US schools I only recommend contacting them if you read their paper and have specific questions, or have very, very close interests (and experience in this interests), or to simply confirm that they are accepting new students in the event that you are accepted to the department. Here are few linguistics departments worth looking at: University of Colorado Boulder, University of Washington, University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Texas Austin, University of Florida :). Computer science departments with faculty members that have strong interest in low-resource languages and/or language documentation: Carnegie Mellon University, George Mason University.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>That's a good question. There will probably never be a definite, measurable amount because so many factors are involved. Normally, natural language processing/computational linguistics algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of words! The rule of thumb is that the more pre-annotated data a model trains on, the better its results. However, researchers are exploring techniques to improve results when training data is limited to thousands or even hundreds of words. I have seen over 90% accuracy reached with as little as 3000 words to train the model. But a whole lot depends on how consistent the linguists annotated the words!</p>
			  
			  <p>Instead of attacking the question of "how much data" directly, better questions might be: Can we achieve results that are accurate enough to speed a linguist's work if we only train on the resources produced by typical language documentation/description field projects? And we significantly speed and improve language documentation tasks if we create a virtuous cycle of computer and human interaction (human-in-the-loop or active learning)? What techniques or pieces of information (computational or linguistic) improve results most significantly? The closest answer I've seen to these questions is in <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3214">Paul Felt's MA thesis</a> where a machine model did automatic prediction and then humans annotators corrected those predictions. The annotators' accuracy and speed started to improve when the model's predictions passed the threshold of 60% accuracy, compared to doing the annotation with no help from the model.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"></p>That almost impossible to answer without knowing what task you want to perform, so  I'll talk generally about how we can improve accuracy with limited hand-annotated data. Keep in mind that most computational models train on thousands or millions of words. With this amount of pre-processed data, the models can achieve up to 97% or sometimes even 99% accuracy at tasks like part-of-speech tagging. The amount of annotated data available for most languages is not nearly enough to achieve that without some clever techniques. One technique is data augmentation or data "hallucination". This increases data by creating words that may not actually exist in the language but adhere to its phonotactics. For example, taking an adjective "capable" and attaching a nominalizing sufix "-ness"; "capableness" may not be a "real" English word but it follows English rules of morphology and phonology. Another technique is called human-in-the-loop (or active learning). This is a virtuous cylce that trains a computational model and then has humans correct the model's worst patterns of error. Then the model is re-trained with the corrections. Hopefully, this second iteration of training greatly improved results. I believe this cycle of analyzing and annotating a small amount of data, then training, correcting, and re-training a model until 95% or more of the work is done by the computer will someday be a vital part of documentary and descriptive linguistic research.</p></div>

			  <p>More and more companies do work on low-resource languages. For example, Microsoft and Google work on languages in India. These languages are not endangered, but have limited data resources for machine learning, so the challenges are very similar to actual endangered languages and your work could benefit them.</p>
