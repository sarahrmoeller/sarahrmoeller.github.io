I know at least one person who insists that computational linguistics only refers to computational modeling of linguistic theories, but you are likely to hear "computational linguistics" and "natural language processing (NLP)" used interchangeably. Both involve programming computers to do interesting things with language. Generally speaking, "computational linguistics" is used more by linguists and "NLP" by the computer science side. A class called "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" in a linguistics department and one called "Introduction to NLP" in a computer science department may use the same textbook and cover the same topics, although adapted to different audiences.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>That's a good question. There will probably never be a definite, measurable answer. Too many factors are involved. Normally, natural language processing/computational linguistics algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of words! The rule of thumb is that the more pre-annotated data a model trains on, the better its results. However, researchers are exploring techniques to improve results when training data is limited to thousands or even hundreds of words. I have seen over 90% accuracy reached with as little as 3000 words to train the model. But a whole lot depends on how consistently the linguists annotated the words!</p>
			  
			  <p>Instead of attacking the question of "how much data" directly, better questions might be:
				 <ul>
					<li>Can we achieve results that accelerate a linguist's work? </li>
					<li>Can we achieve useful results with models trained on the resources produced by typical field projects, in language documentation and description?</li>
					<li>Human-in-the-loop systems create a virtuous cycle of computer and human interaction, could this interaction improve language documentation tasks?</li>
					<li>What techniques or pieces of information (computational or linguistic) improve results most dramatically?</li>
				</ul> </p>
				
				<p>The closest answers I've seen to these questions are in <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3214">Paul Felt's MA thesis</a> where a machine model did automatic prediction and then humans annotators corrected those predictions. The annotators' accuracy and speed started to improve when the model's predictions passed the threshold of 60% accuracy, compared to doing annotation with no help from the model.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"></p>That is almost impossible to answer without knowing what task you want to perform, so I'll talk generally about how we can improve accuracy with limited hand-annotated data. Keep in mind that most computational models train on thousands or millions of words. With this amount of pre-processed data, the models can achieve up to 97% or sometimes even 99% accuracy at tasks like part-of-speech tagging. The amount of annotated data available for most languages is not nearly enough to achieve that without some clever techniques. One technique is data augmentation or data "hallucination". This increases data by automatically creating words that may not actually exist in the language but adhere to its rules. For example, taking an adjective "capable" and attaching a nominalizing sufix "-ness" gives "capableness". This may not be a real English word but it follows English rules of morphology and phonology. Another technique is called human-in-the-loop (or active learning). This is a virtuous cycle that trains a computational model and then humans correct the model's worst errors. The model is then re-trained with those corrections. Hopefully, this second iteration of training greatly improves results. I believe this cycle of analyzing and annotating a small amount of data, training, predicting, correcting, and re-training a model will someday be a vital part of documentary and descriptive linguistic research. Perhaps models trained this way will achieve 99% accuracy without millions of words!</p>

I was launched into NLP by talking to computational linguists at the <a href=""http://icldc-hawaii.org/">International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation</a> (ICLDC) and I recommend this conference for anyone working in minority languages. You may find like-minded people as you <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/5960">browse its past presentations</a>. The <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/62932">2019 conference</a> had a technology theme so it's a great place to start.</p>
			  
			  <p>“The Workshop for the Use of Computational Methods for Endangered Languages” (ComputEL) is another event that brings together linguists, computer scientists, and community members.  If you see a project there that sounds like something you want to do, contact the authors. Note that some articles are fairly technical.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Not so many years ago, I was where you are now, very much interested in computational linguistics but a novice in computer science. Fortunately, NLP is an exploding field and getting started should be easier for you.</p>
			  
			  <p>I was told to find a computer scientist with similar interests and collaborate with them.  Collaborations like that do produce great work. For examples, see the automated transcription tool <a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki">ELPIS</a> or <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/">SignStream</a> for linguistic analysis of American Sign Language.</p>
			  
			  <p>That answer did not satisfy me and I took another path. For me the solution was to dive into programming and practice, practice, practice. Computer programming has a steep, but happily, a short, learning curve. I strongly recommend that you take a bootcamp or classes with an in-person teacher. I took a free class through a non-profit called <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a> which is available in some USA cities. After Programming 101, take a class in data structures and algorithms to learn how to think like a programmer.</p>
			   
			  <p>If you have a basic programming foundation, a degree program might be the most efficient way to get your foot in the job market door.</p>

If your school does not have a computational linguistics or NLP major, then I recommend doing a major/minor combination in linguistics and either computer science or data science. You can approach computational linguistics as a linguist with computer science skills or as a computer scientist who works with languages.  In computer science, this is commonly known as natural language processing (NLP). I come from the linguistics side and more than once I have regretted that I didn't take any computer science classes in my undergrad. I majored in history and I didn't discover linguistics until after I graduated. </p>

			  <p>Check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WRUWheQiV90n7La5DeuYqbQ49r6JGPHnb5GTwEqwfQ/edit?usp=sharing">recommended "co-requisites"</a>. At bare minimum, take an introductory programming class, preferably one that teaches Python. The programming language ‘R’ also has some uses. After that, take a class in data structures and algorithms.</p>
			  
			  <p>Life will be much easier if you have a grasp of probability and statistics, linear algebra (vectors and matrices) and some beginner calculus (including a general understanding of partial derivatives). I found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos on linear algebra and calculus were sufficient, as you don’t have to master these subjects. But I often wish I had taken more classes in statistics! Importantly, don't let fear of math, keep you from pursuing this field. Remember, Cs get degrees!.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you're looking for a graduate school, here's a <a href="https://nschneid.github.io/nlp-in-ling/">list of linguistics departments in North American univerisities with computational linguistic faculty</a>. Before contacting a program, explore faculty websites and publications. I recommend contacting them only after you read (or skimmed) one of their papers, have a simple, specific question, or have very similar interests. I know that I rarely have time to respond to general inquiries by prospective students. The exception to this rule is a short email to determine whether they are accepting new advisees. If they say "no", don't waste your application fee.</p>
			  
			  <p>Personally, I don't recommend the PhD path unless you prepared to enter the limited academic job market. The number of professional master programs in computational linguistics/NLP is exploding! For example, University of Colorado (my alma mater) has their well-established <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/computational-linguistics-analytics-search-and-informatics">CLASIC</a> program. The <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/online/courses">University of Washington</a> has an online program and some of their coureses are offered free through <a href="https://www.pce.uw.edu/online/free-online-programs">Coursera and edX</a>. At the University of Florida we have plans to develop a MA program in computational linguistics!</p>
			  
			  <p>Finally, consider whether you are more interested in computational modeling, that is, computational linguistics in the strict sense, or in data-driven applied work. It can be difficult to find both approaches in one university, at least in North America</p>

On the other hand, computer science or linguistics university departments are competing against higher-paying industry jobs. So, these positions tend to be less competitive than for other faculty positions.</p>
			  
			  <p>Languages with small communities are not commercially profitable but more and more companies are working with low-resource languages. For example, both Microsoft and Google work with minority languages in India. (In India, "minority" can still mean 1 million speakers!) These languages are not endangered, but resources for training NLP models are limited. A challenge you solve in industry could, if made available, benefit endangered language communities.</p>
