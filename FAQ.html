I know at least one person who insists that computational linguistics only refers to computational modeling of linguistic theories but you are likely to hear "computational linguistics" and "natural language processing (NLP)" used interchangeably. Both involve programming computers to do interesting things with language. Generally speaking, "computational linguistics" is used more by linguists and "NLP" by the computer science side. A class called "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" in a linguistics department or "Introduction to NLP" in a computer science department may use the same textbook and cover the same topics, although adapted to different audiences.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Not so many years ago, I was where you are now---very much interested in computational linguistics but an absolute novice in computer science. Fortunately, NLP is an exploding field and getting started should be easier for you. I was told to find a computer scientist interested in what I wanted to accomplish and collaborate with them. Such collaborations do produce great work, such as the automated transcription tool <a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki">ELPIS</a> and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/">SignStream</a> for linguistic analysis of American Sign Language.</p>
			  
			  <p>I took the another path because that answer did not satisfy me. The solution is to dive in and practice, practice, practice your programming skills. Computer programming has a steep, but short, learning curve and I highly recommend investing in a bootcamp or classes with an in-person teacher. I took a free class through a non-profit called <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a> which is available in some cities. After Programming 101, take a class in data structures and algorithms to learn how to think like a programmer.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Great question! You can approach computational linguistics from as linguist with computer science skills or as a computer scientist who works with languages (in computer science, this is commonly known as natural language processing (NLP)). I come from the linguistics side and more than once I have regretted that I didn't take any computer science classes in my undergrad. (I majored in history - I didn't discover linguistics until after I graduated). If your school does not have a computational linguistics or NLP major, then I recommend doing a major/minor combination in linguistics and either computer science or data science.</p>
			  
			  <p>At bare minimum, if you are undergraduate with a humanities major, take an introductory programming class, preferably one that teaches Python, although R has some uses. After that, take a class in data structures and algorithms. Life will be much easier if you are familiar with probability and statistics, linear algebra (vectors and matrices), and some calculus (basic notations and an intuitive understanding of partial derivatives). That doesn't mean you have to master those subjects, however. I found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos on linear algebra and calculus sufficient. But I really wish I had more good classes in statistics! Don't be afraid of math; remember Cs get degrees! Here's my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17WRUWheQiV90n7La5DeuYqbQ49r6JGPHnb5GTwEqwfQ/edit?usp=sharing">recommended "co-requisites"</a>.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you're looking a graduate school, take a look at this <a href="https://nschneid.github.io/nlp-in-ling/">list of Linguistics departments in North American univerisities with computational linguistic. Explore faculty websites and publications to determine their research interests before you contact them. In fact, I recommend contacting them only if you read one of their papers or have specific questions, or have very, very close interests. I know I rarely have time to respond to general inquiries by students. The exception to this rule is a short email to determine whether they are accepting new students. If they say "no", don't waste your application fee.</p>
			  
			  <p>Personally, I don't recommend the PhD path unless you quite ready to enter the limited academic job market or if you have 5-10 years laying around. The number of professional master programs in computational linguistics/NLP is growing with the job market! For example, the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/computational-linguistics-analytics-search-and-informatics">CLASIC</a> program at the University of Colorado Boulder is a establish program and the University of Washington has online program. If you do decide on a PhD program, look first for an advisor whose research interests match yours. You also want to consider the size of the student stipend and the cost of living, and the average completion time for students in the department and under that specific professor, as well as the reputation of that professor, not just as a scholar but how they treat their students. Finally, consider whether you are more interested in computational modeling (computational linguistics, in the strict sense) or in data-driven, engineering, or applied work. It can be difficult to find both approaches in one university, at least not in North America</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>That's a good question. There will probably never be a definite, measurable amount because so many factors are involved. Normally, natural language processing/computational linguistics algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of words! The rule of thumb is that the more pre-annotated data a model trains on, the better its results. However, researchers are exploring techniques to improve results when training data is limited to thousands or even hundreds of words. I have seen over 90% accuracy reached with as little as 3000 words to train the model. But a whole lot depends on how consistent the linguists annotated the words!</p>
			  
			  <p>Instead of attacking the question of "how much data" directly, better questions might be: Can we achieve results that are accurate enough to speed a linguist's work if we only train on the resources produced by typical language documentation/description field projects? And we significantly speed and improve language documentation tasks if we create a virtuous cycle of computer and human interaction (human-in-the-loop or active learning)? What techniques or pieces of information (computational or linguistic) improve results most significantly? The closest answer I've seen to these questions is in <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3214">Paul Felt's MA thesis</a> where a machine model did automatic prediction and then humans annotators corrected those predictions. The annotators' accuracy and speed started to improve when the model's predictions passed the threshold of 60% accuracy, compared to doing the annotation with no help from the model.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"></p>That almost impossible to answer without knowing what task you want to perform, so  I'll talk generally about how we can improve accuracy with limited hand-annotated data. Keep in mind that most computational models train on thousands or millions of words. With this amount of pre-processed data, the models can achieve up to 97% or sometimes even 99% accuracy at tasks like part-of-speech tagging. The amount of annotated data available for most languages is not nearly enough to achieve that without some clever techniques. One technique is data augmentation or data "hallucination". This increases data by creating words that may not actually exist in the language but adhere to its phonotactics. For example, taking an adjective "capable" and attaching a nominalizing sufix "-ness"; "capableness" may not be a "real" English word but it follows English rules of morphology and phonology. Another technique is called human-in-the-loop (or active learning). This is a virtuous cylce that trains a computational model and then has humans correct the model's worst patterns of error. Then the model is re-trained with the corrections. Hopefully, this second iteration of training greatly improved results. I believe this cycle of analyzing and annotating a small amount of data, then training, correcting, and re-training a model until 95% or more of the work is done by the computer will someday be a vital part of documentary and descriptive linguistic research.</p></div>

			  <p>More and more companies do work on low-resource languages. For example, Microsoft and Google are work with minority languages in India. (in India, "minority" can still mean 1 million speakers! These languages are not endangered, but have limited resources to train machine learning for NLP.
