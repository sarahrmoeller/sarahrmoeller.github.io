              <div class="panel-body"><p>The terms "computational linguistics" and "natural language processing (NLP)" are often used interchangeably. Both involve programming computers to do interesting things with language. For example, an identical curriculum might be called "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" in a linguistics department but "Introduce to NLP" in a computer science department.</p>
			  
			  <p>There doesn't seem to be a clear consensus on how the two differ, but generally speaking, computational linguistics is usually more "linguistic-y" while NLP is more "computer science-y". I think the main difference that you may encounter is that computational linguistics may be used to only refer to computer models of linguistic theories. These models are built to see if their output matches what the theory would predict, given specific input.</p>

Talking to computational linguists at the <a href=""http://icldc-hawaii.org/">International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation</a> (ICLDC) was a catalyst for my shift to computational linguistics. I recommend this conference for anyone working in minority languages. It occurs biannually at the University of Hawaii. In the meantime, you may find people to connect with as you browse past presentations <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/5960">here</a>. The <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/62932">2019 conference</a>had a technology theme so I would start there.</p>
			  
			  <p>The Workshop for the Use of Computational Methods for Endangered Languages (<a href="https://computel-workshop.org/">ComputEL</a>) is another biannual event that usually co-locates with ICDLC. It has a specific goal to bring together linguistics, computer scientists, and community members. You can find conference proceedings through the website, but be aware that some articles are fairly technical. If you see a project that sounds like something you want to do, try contacting the authors!</p>
			  
			 <p>If you are interested in building software apps, the people at Language Software Development of SIL International may have good advice. If you have an idea for language technology that does not involve specific natural language processing or machine learning skills, you might contact a local hackathon to see if you can pitch a project. Some hackathons focus on projects for non-profits.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Not so many years ago, I was where you are now---very much interested in computational linguistics but an absolute novice in computer science. It can be difficult to find the right path! Fortunately, it is a growing field and I hope it will be easier for you than me. </p>
			  
			  <p>There are two general paths if you are starting from zero computer science. The first path is what was originally recommended to me: find a computer scienctist who is interested in what you want to accomplish and collaborate with them. Such collaborations are producing very nice tools, such as the automated transcription tool <a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki">ELPIS</a> and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/">SignStream</a> for linguistic analysis of American Sign Language.</p>
			  
			  <p>I took the second path because I was not satisfied with the first answer. The second path is to dive into computational linguistics/Natural Language Processing and practice, practice, practice till your programming skills are fluent. The first thing is to learn the computer language called Python. I highly recommend investing in a programming bootcamp or classes with an instructor. Even though I am a huge fan of non-traditional and independent learning, having a mentor when you start is a must! Computer programming has a steep, but short, learning curve. I took a wonderful (and free) class through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>. Even if you learn basic programming concepts in langauges like C, C#, C++ or Java, it's fairly easy learn your second language. Python is one of the easiest. After an intro to programming, take a class in data structures and algorithms. This will help you code more efficiently and strategically.</p>
			   
			  <p>Once you’ve laid the programming and math foundation, a degree program is probably the fastest and most efficient way to continue. There are a few professional Master's in computational linguistics or NLP are on the rise. And there will probably be more as the demand in industry grows! The <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/computational-linguistics-analytics-search-and-informatics">CLASIC</a> program at the University of Colorado Boulder is a good example. Univeristy of Washington has one with an online component. Boston University and San Jose State University both have declared plans to develop similar programs.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>That's a good question. There will probably never be a definite, measurable amount because so many factors are involved. Normally, natural language processing/computational linguistics algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of words! The rule of thumb is that the more pre-annotated data a model trains on, the better its results. However, researchers are exploring techniques to improve results when training data is limited to thousands or even hundreds of words. I have seen over 90% accuracy reached with as little as 3000 words to train the model. But a whole lot depends on how consistent the linguists annotated the words!</p>
			  
			  <p>Instead of attacking the question of "how much data" directly, better questions might be: Can we achieve results that are accurate enough to speed a linguist's work if we only train on the resources produced by typical language documentation/description field projects? And we significantly speed and improve language documentation tasks if we create a virtuous cycle of computer and human interaction (human-in-the-loop or active learning)? What techniques or pieces of information (computational or linguistic) improve results most significantly? The closest answer I've seen to these questions is in <a href="https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/3214">Paul Felt's MA thesis</a> where a machine model did automatic prediction and then humans annotators corrected those predictions. The annotators' accuracy and speed started to improve when the model's predictions passed the threshold of 60% accuracy, compared to doing the annotation with no help from the model.</p></div>

              <div class="panel-body"></p>That almost impossible to answer without knowing what task you want to perform, so  I'll talk generally about how we can improve accuracy with limited hand-annotated data. Keep in mind that most computational models train on thousands or millions of words. With this amount of pre-processed data, the models can achieve up to 97% or sometimes even 99% accuracy at tasks like part-of-speech tagging. The amount of annotated data available for most languages is not nearly enough to achieve that without some clever techniques. One technique is data augmentation or data "hallucination". This increases data by creating words that may not actually exist in the language but adhere to its phonotactics. For example, taking an adjective "capable" and attaching a nominalizing sufix "-ness"; "capableness" may not be a "real" English word but it follows English rules of morphology and phonology. Another technique is called human-in-the-loop (or active learning). This is a virtuous cylce that trains a computational model and then has humans correct the model's worst patterns of error. Then the model is re-trained with the corrections. Hopefully, this second iteration of training greatly improved results. I believe this cycle of analyzing and annotating a small amount of data, then training, correcting, and re-training a model until 95% or more of the work is done by the computer will someday be a vital part of documentary and descriptive linguistic research.</p></div>

			  <p>Other people, such as Lane Schwartz at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaigne, have written about creating a data corpus for NLP. Some day I will augment this section with links and tips.</p>
			  
			  <p>Language archives such as <a href="http://elar-archive.org/index.php">ELAR</a>, <a href="http://www.paradisec.org.au/">PARADISEC</a>, and <a href="https://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives">SIL Language and Culture Archive</a> do not require or recommend (as far as I know) users to format and pre-process their data for computational linguists' ease of use and that's just fine but it means we probably don't access those resources as much as we could wish.

              <div class="panel-body"><p>Great question! You can approach computational linguistics from as linguist with computer science skills or as a computer scientist who works with languages (in computer science, this is commonly known as natural language processing (NLP)). I come from the linguistics side and more than once I have regretted that I didn't take any computer science classes in my undergrad. (I majored in history - I didn't discover linguistics until after I graduated). If your school does not have a computational linguistics or NLP major, then I recommend doing a major/minor combination in linguistics and either computer science or data science.</p>
			  
			  <p>At bare minimum, if you are a linguistics major, take an introductory programming class, preferably one that teaches Python, although R has some uses. After that, take a class in data structures and algorithms. You may want to look the information science or data science courses instead of computer science, because computer science courses may be more math-heavy.</p>
			  
			  <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVQ0N5QqyTHsF1ebbabARg-VNlcSgdJJQLfe5GycPqE/edit?usp=sharing">recommended "co-requisites"</a> I compiled for the University of Colorado students. 
			  TL;DR: Life will be much easier if you are familiar with probability and statistics, linear algebra (vectors and matrices), and some calculus (basic notations and an intuitive understanding of partial derivatives). That doesn't mean you have to master those subjects, however. I found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos on linear algebra and calculus sufficient. But I really wish I had more good classes in statistics!</p>
			  
			  <p>For prospective graduate students, a very few but growing number of schools have faculty research in NLP/computational linguistics and endangered or low-resource languages. Explore faculty websites and publications to determine their research interests before you contact them. In fact, at US schools I only recommend contacting them if you read their paper and have specific questions, or have very, very close interests (and experience in this interests), or to simply confirm that they are accepting new students in the event that you are accepted to the department. Here are few linguistics departments worth looking at: University of Colorado Boulder, University of Washington, University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Texas Austin, University of Florida :). Computer science departments with faculty members that have strong interest in low-resource languages and/or language documentation: Carnegie Mellon University, George Mason University.</p>
