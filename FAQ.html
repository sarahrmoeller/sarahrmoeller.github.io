              <div class="panel-body"><p>The terms "computational linguistics" and "natural language processing (NLP)" are sometimes used interchangeably. Both program computers to do interesting things with language. There doesn't seem to be a clear consensus on how the two differ, but generally speaking, computational linguistics is usually more "linguistic-y" while NLP is more computer science-y. The same class might be called "Introduction to Computational Linguistics" in a linguistics department but "Introduce to NLP" in a computer science department. I think the main thing to be aware of is that computational linguistics sometimes means programming models of linguistic theories to see how the output matches what the theory would predict with given input. Others have <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-computational-linguistics-different-from-natural-language-processing">answered these questions</a> more thoroughly.</p></div>

The <a href=""http://icldc-hawaii.org/">International Conference on Language Documentation and Conservation</a> (ICLDC) was a catalyst for my shift to computational linguistics. I recommend this conference for anyone working in minority languages. It occurs biannually at the University of Hawaii.  You may find people to connect with as you browse past presentations! You can all conferences presentations <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/5960">here</a>. The <a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/62932">2019 conference</a>had a technology theme so I would start there.</p>
			  
			  <p>The Workshop for the Use of Computational Methods for Endangered Languages (<a href="https://computel-workshop.org/">ComputEL</a>) is another biannual event that usually co-locates with ICDLC. It has a specific goal to bring together linguistics, computer scientists, and community members. You can find conference proceedings through the website, but be aware that some articles are fairly technical. If you see a project that sounds like something you want to do, try contacting the authors!</p>
			  
			  <p>A few schools have research in NLP/computational linguistics for low-resource languages as well as language documentation/description. Explore people's websites and publications to determine their research interests before you contact them. Here are few linguistics departments in the USA worth looking at: University of Colorado, University of Washington, Boston University (sign langauges), University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne(morphology/Yupik), University of Texas Austin, University of North Texas.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you are just interested in building software apps, the people at Language Software Development of SIL International may have good advice. If you have an idea for language technology that does not involve specific natural language processing or machine learning skills, you might contact a local hackathon to see if you can pitch a project. Some hackathons focus on projects for non-profits.</p>

              <div class="panel-body"><p>A few years ago, I was where you are---very much interested in computational linguistics but still a novice in computer programming. I know how difficult it is to find the right path. Fortunately, it is a growing field and I hope it will be easier for you than me. I think there two possible paths if you are starting from zero.</p>
			  
			  <p>The first path is what was originally recommended to me: find someone in computer science who is interested in what you want to accomplish and collaborate with them. Such collaborations are producing very nice tools, such as the automated transcription tool <a href="https://github.com/CoEDL/elpis/wiki">ELPIS</a> and <a href="http://www.bu.edu/asllrp/">SignStream</a> for linguistic analysis of American Sign Language.</p>
			  
			  <p>I took the second path because I was not satisfied with the first answer; I wanted more. You can dive into computational linguistics/Natural Language Processing yourself. In that case, the first thing is to learn the computer language called Python. I highly recommend investing in a programming bootcamp or classes with an instructor. Computer programming has a steep, but short learning curve. I took a wonderful (and free) class through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>. Even if you can't find a course in Python, once you learn basic programming concepts in C, C#, C++ or Java, it's pretty easy learn your second language. And Python is one of the easiest. (Personally, I am very glad that I also first took a general introduction to Computer Science, but it's not necessary.) After a intro to programming, take a class in (data structures and) algorithms. This will make you coding more efficient and strategic.</p>
			  
			  <p>Also, life will be much easier if you are familiar with probability and statistics, linear algebra (vectors and matrices), and some calculus (basic notations and an intuitive understanding of partial derivatives). That doesn't mean you have to master those subjects, however. I found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> videos on linear algebra and calculus very helpful, but I really wish I had more good classes in statistics.</p>
			  
			  <p>Once you’ve laid the programming and math foundation, a degree program is probably the fastest and most efficient way to continue. Professional Master's in computational linguistics are increasing. The <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/computational-linguistics-analytics-search-and-informatics">CLASIC</a> program at my alma mater University of Colorad Boulder is a good example.</p>

              <div class="panel-body">That's a good question. There will probably never be a definite, measurable amount because so many factors are involved but I hope to provide some clarity. Normally, natural language processing/computational linguistics algorithms are trained on hundreds of thousands or millions of words! The rule of thumb is that the more pre-annotated data a computer trains on, the better its results. However, researchers are exploring techniques to improve results when training data is limited to thousands or even hundreds of words. Instead of attacking that question directly, my research focuses on: Can we achieve results that are accurate enough to speed a linguist's work (at least 60%-80% accurate) if we use the resources produced by typical language documentation/description field projects? And if so, how? What techniques (computational or linguistic) improve results? I have seen that ballpark of accuracy reached with as little as 3000 segmented and glossed words. But a whole lot depends on how consistent those segmentation and glosses were!</div>

              <div class="panel-body">That is a really hard question to answer without knowing what task you want to perform, so instead I'll talk genearlly about what can be done to increase accuracy. Keep in mind that most computational models train on thousands or millions of words. With this amount of pre-processed data, the models can achieve up to 97% or sometimes even 99% accuracy. The amount of preprocessed, annotated data available for most languages is not nearly enough to achieve that accuracy without some clever technique. One technique is data augmentation or data "hallucination". This increases data by creating words that do not exist in the language but still adhere to its structural patterns. For example, taking an adjective "capable" and attaching a nominalizing sufix "ness"; "capableness" may not be a "real" word but it follows English rules of morphology and phonology. Another technique is called active learning which trains a computational model and then has humans correct the worst patterns of error. Then the model is re-trained, hopefully with greatly improved results. This cycle of analyzing and annotating a small amount of data, then training, correcting, and re-training a model until 95% or more of the work is done by the computer will someday be a vital part of linguistic annotation and documentary field methods.</div>

Sometimes I can even get funding to compensate their time. I'd love to have more collaborators on research and publications! Of course, we must do due diligence to get informed consent from all appropriate parties.</p>
			  
			  <p>An obvious source for language data are language archives such as <a href="http://elar-archive.org/index.php">ELAR</a>, <a href="http://www.paradisec.org.au/">PARADISEC</a>, and <a href="https://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives">SIL Language and Culture Archive</a>.

You can approach computational linguistics from a strong linguistic background or as a computer scientist with a strong interest linguistics (in computer science, it's more commonly known as natural language processing (NLP)). I come from the linguistics side and I started with an Introduction to Computer Science (mostly using the C language). More than once I have regretted that I didn't take any computer science classes in my undergrad. (I majored in history - I didn't discover linguistics until after I graduated). If your school does not have a computational linguistics or natural language processing track/major, then I recommend some major/minor combination in linguistics and either computer science or data science. At bare minimum, if you are a linguistics major, take an introductory programming class, preferably one that teaches Python and then a class in data structures and algorithms. I point my linguistics students to the information science department rather than the computer science when they express a reluctance to take math-heavy classes.</div>
